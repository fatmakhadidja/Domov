## Description of the application

This Flutter project is for a mobile application UI tailored to facilitate remote control of a smart switch.
The application is designed to provide users with seamless interaction and management capabilities over their smart switch devices.

- A video that demonstrates the functionalities of the mobile application will be found in the 'assets' directory along with the assets used in this project .

# Demonstration : 
## Welcome page : 
The first page that encounters the user, it displays a simple and minimalistic interface with a start button in the bottom right.

## Home page : 
the home page is displayed to the user when he hits the start button of the welcome page, it contains the devices that the smart switch can control alongside with their states ( ON / OFF ), the user can control these devices remotely by clicking on their buttons ( this is just the UI of the applicaion, there are no requests being handled to ensure the control of the devices )

## Security page : 
the user can access to this page when he presses on the shield icon on the top right of the home page, here he can change the credentials of the network that the smart switch is connected to ( AGAIN, this is just the UI, there are no credentials getting changed using this repo :3 )
